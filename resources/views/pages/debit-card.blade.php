                <p><strong>Do I need to use a Pin with my Mastercard chip card?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, in most cases you’ll input your PIN for debit card purchases. For certain types of transactions involving relatively small purchase amounts, you may not be required to input your PIN or sign for the transaction.</p>
                <p><strong>Where can I use my chip card?</strong></p>
                <p>You can use your card where you always have, at millions of places that accept Mastercard® Debit cards, at home, and around the world.</p>
                <p><strong>How am I protected by Mastercard’s Zero Liability Policy?</strong></p>
                <p>If your card is lost or stolen, you are protected against unauthorized transactions. As a Mastercard cardholder, Zero Liability applies to your purchases made in the store, over the telephone, online, or via a mobile device and ATM transactions. As a cardholder, you will not be held responsible for unauthorized transactions if:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have used reasonable care in protecting your card from loss or theft; and</li>
                    <li>You promptly reported loss or theft to your financial institution.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you believe there has been unauthorized use of your account and you meet the conditions above, rest easy knowing you have the protection of Mastercard’s Zero Liability promise. For additional protections with respect to unauthorized transactions, please contact your local banking center or our Customer Service at 800-531-1401. Note: Zero Liability does not apply to the following Mastercard payment cards: commercial cards, or unregistered prepaid cards, such as gift cards.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                <p>If you have questions regarding Zero Liability coverage or you suspect unauthorized use of your card, contact your financial institution immediately.</p>
